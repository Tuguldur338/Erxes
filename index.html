                    <h3>On the west coast of Madagascar, dozens of ancient baobabs trees strikingly frame the dirt path between Morondava and Belon'i Tsiribihina.</h3>
                    <h3>The towering 800-year-old trees extend upwards to the dusty sky, creating a dramatic scene that can be seen from miles away.</h3>
                    <h3>It's said the rare trees were once a part of a much larger forest, but due to urbanization much of it had been torn down.</h3>
                    <h3>In an effort to preserve the path, local activists successfully petitioned for the Avenue of the Baobabs to become Madagascar's first natural monument.</h3>
